This repository is the official implementation of [Knowledge Source Integration on Medical Code Prediction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313485).

>ðŸ“‹  The article titled "Improving Medical Code Prediction from Clinical Text via Incorporating Online Knowledge Sources" discusses the importance of translating clinical notes into a standardized format that can be read by computers. This process is typically performed by trained staff and is both time-consuming and expensive. To address this problem, there is a growing interest in developing automatic code assignment models. However, it remains a challenge to fully automate the process. This article proposes a solution to address this challenge. This paper discussed the end-to-end framework called Knowledge Source Integration (KSI), which enables the incorporation of external knowledge while training a model. 


## Requirements

1. Install Python3, enable Cuda on the machine.  <br>
2. Install packages using pip. The following packages needs: stop-words, numpy, scikit-learn. <br>
```setup
pip install numpy scikit-learn stop-words
```
3. Download the two datasets needed for this code: NOTEEVENTS.csv and DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv. These datasets can be downloaded from the MIMIC-III database.


## Data Processing

1. Download the two CSV files, "NOTEEVENTS.csv" and "DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv" <br>
```setup
  You can download two CSV files here:
- [NOTEEVENTS.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13fs4Zn-LyOtqBHgp0V9FN8PQi3LIMN53/view?usp=sharing).
- [DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VG51aodS4omPDcIv6m2oQFnjxZwRawmc/view?usp=sharing).
```
2. Place the two CSV files in the same directory as the following files and directories: IDlist.npy, wikipedia_knowledge, p1, p2 and p3. <br>
3. Run the following commands in order to preprocess the data: 
``` setup
python3 p1.py, python3 p2.py, and python3 p3.py  
```
4. Once these scripts have completed running, the fully preprocessed dataset ready for use.  <br>

## Training

1.To train the CNN and KSI+CNN models in the paper, run this command:
```train
python KSI_CNN_RZ_20230506.py
```
2.To train the RNN and KSI+RNN (LSTM) models in the paper, run this command:
```train
KSI_LSTM_RZ_20230507.py
```
3.The evaluation metrics will show up automatically after the model run

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
